<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are a few things most laksas have in common: noodles, a main topping such as prawn or chicken, and a bold, flavorful broth. 
That's sometimes where the similarities endâ€”like many dishes, laksas differ by region, taking on a slightly different form depending on where it's being made and who's making it.
</p>
<p>This makes perfect sense considering laksa's origins. 
The noodle soup is thought to be a blending of Chinese and Malaysian or Javanese cuisines, either through the merging of cultures or intermarriage.

    <ol>

        <li>Heat the peanut oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy-duty pot over medium heat until it shimmers.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
