<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Molten chocolate cake is a French dessert that consists of a chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate core. It is named for that molten center, and it is also known as mi-cuit au chocolat, chocolat coulant ("flowing"), chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cocoa</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li> 1/8 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp. vanilla
    <li>2 Tbsp. dark chocolate chips (or 2 oz, 2 squares bar chocolate)</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. creamy peanut butter</li>
    <li>whipped cream (for topping)</li>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place flour, baking powder, cocoa, sugar and salt in a small bowl. Whisk to compbine.</li>
    <li>Add the milk, oil and vanilla. Whisk until well blended.</li>
    <li>Divide the batter between 2 large mugs (I used 14 oz mugs). Microwave for 30-45 seconds on high.</li>
    <li>Remove the mugs and place 1 tbs of the chocolate chips into each mug. Next add 1 tbs of peanut butter to each mug. Press the chips and peanut butter into the batter.<li>
    <li>Return the mugs to the microwave and cook for an additional 30 seconds to 2 minutes. The length of time will depend on your microwave's power so an exact time can't be reliably calculated. When the batter rises to the top of the mug, that is when the cakes are done so you must watch it carefully.</li>
